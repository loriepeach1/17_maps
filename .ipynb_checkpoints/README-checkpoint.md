### Data Sets
* [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)  - choose the dataset for eqrthquakes in the last 7 days.
* Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.



### Assignment Overview

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.

* Plot a second data set on the map of fault lines.    This requires a 2nd data set.

* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out the two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to the map.
